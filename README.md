# Automatidata
Exploratory data analysis for a taxi company that predicts ride fares
Scenario:

The New York City TLC data is ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python. You will need to clean, join, validate, and create a visualization for the taxi commission data. The findings will be shared with internal stakeholders from different departments within Automatidata.

This project also shows the PACE framework I have learned and the detail description and insights and conclusions I have came up with during the learning process.
